# FPGA-based-rover.Verilog
Semi-autonomous rover Verilog project for the Project Lab I class, writtten during the 2017 summer 
at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas Tech University. 

Programmed on the Xilinx Vivado environment for the Xilinx Basys3 FPGA.
TOP module: basysConnections.v
OBS: some higher-module simulation files might not as expected. 
With the exception of the current sensing module - which hasn't been tested enough - all modules work as expected.
